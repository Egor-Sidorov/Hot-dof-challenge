# Hot-dof-challenge

Here you can find the model for In-class Kaggle competition (https://www.kaggle.com/c/spbu-hotdog/overview)

Competition is based on Silicon Valley movie: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIci3C4JkL0&t=38s
We need to predict if a given image is a hot dog or not. The quality of the model is measured by AUC-ROC metric.

We used CNN based on a pre-trained Xception model with data augmentation, wich allowed to take the 2nd place on the private leaderboard
